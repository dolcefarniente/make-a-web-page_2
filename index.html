          When learning a new language, where shall we start? Especially when the goal is to communicate with a <em>machine</em>, rather than a human being!!! One intuitive place to begin for newbies is web pages, something that those of us who have only
          used mices and keyboards are familiar with.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do web pages magically appear when we click on a link in our computer's browser? Apparently, when we click on a hyperlink, the browser sends <em>HyperText Transfer Protocol requests</em> via the Internet to the appropriate <em>server</em>.
          That server then identifies the relevant <em>HyperText Markup Language</em> and reverts via the Internet to our browser, which converts the HTTP into the visual webpage for our viewing pleasure.

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          What is this HTML that transfers content between browsers and servers? Apparently, HTML is a language composed of underlying text, references to documents, and links to web pages that browsers and servers understand. The browser reads the underlying HTML
          <em>text content</em> to create a visual <em>mark-up</em>, which is what we humans see displayed as the web page in our browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML text content is structured as a tree of HTML <em>elements</em>, each of which are composed of opening tag, content, followed by closing tag. <em>Tags</em> of the same type denote where each element begins and ends.

        <p>
          When speaking "computer" to a browser, people must be specific as to their HTML syntax. Computers only understand exactly what is conveyed to them, and will not correct for human errors. For example, forgetting to include the closing tag in the HTML text
          content of an element (excluding void tags) will result in the continuation of that element because the browser has only been told where to start but not where to end.

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Elements are bifurcated into <em>inline</em> and <em>block</em> elements relating to line breaks as displayed in mark-ups. The former types of elements retains its content in one line. The latter creates an invisible box around the element and
          cordons it off; thus, when a block element is used, it appears on its own line. Examples of inline elements include "a", "b", "em", "img", "strong", "br" and "span". Examples of block elements include "p", "div" and "form".

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          A web page's components are given structure via its HTML, style via <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>, and interactive components via Javascript. We may view these components through the browser's <em>Developer Tools</em>. HTML and CSS are both
          computer languages that have their respective syntax and rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          The basic word in HTML is tags, which are turned into elements that together form a tree. This is otherwise known as the <em>Document Object Model</em> for interacting with HTML. Using HTML, the browser builds a tree-like structure of the web
          page, with elements containing additional content (another element, text, or even be empty).
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS, on the other hand, is used to adjust how elements look on the page, <em>e.g.</em> size of the font, color, etc.

      </div>
      <div class="concept description">
        <p>
          Every element on a web page is a box. (This can be proven by unchecking the border-radius box in CSS.) As a function of this, when coding a web page, a front-end web developer will first "boxify" the design she is given. This is done by drawing boxes
          around each element, whether electronically or by hand, starting from the whole page and then divvying up into smaller boxes. The purpose of the boxifying exercise is to determine the HTML document structure of the web page, with each box defined
          by a set of "div" tags (sets of div tags may exist within other div tags). Also, when coding, each boxed element should be given an informative class name (think: labels on boxes) that makes it clear what such element refers to in relation to
          the web page design.

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          1. Write CSS in the "head" of the HTML in between "style" tags, such as when using scratchpad.io.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Write CSS in a main.CSS and a separate main.HTML file, such as when using Sublime Text. Then in the HTML, place a "head" element and add a "link" tag within that element.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is defined in the following form: selector "{property:value}". In the following example, if you want to make it a rule that all "h1" elements are pink, then you'd write
          <br>
          <br> h1 {
          <br> color:pink;
          <br> }
          <br>
          <br> There are also options to further break down the selector by class, so that the rule applies to only certain of the same element and not all of the elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS Reference</a> lists the many types of CSS properties, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, @-rules, units, and selectors.

      </div>
      <div class="concept description">
        <p>
          Each boxed HTML element has 4 components, which are concentric layers in the following order from inside to out:
          <p>
            Content: image or text that appears on web page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Padding: clears an area about the content and is affected by background content of box.
          </p>
          <p>
            Border: color property of the box.
          </p>
          <p>
            Margin: transparent spaces between boxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The size of your element in pixels is equal to the sum of the border, padding, and content widths. Using the "box-sizing: border-box" in CSS, you can fix the dimensions of the boxed element.

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Each "div" is a boxed element that by default takes up the entire width of a page. To align two or more "div" elements so that they are adjacent to one another, you can override this default via the flexbox rule: in the parent element's "element.style",
          you input "display: flex".

          This is the method of going from the design to the web page:
          <br>
          <br> Code: (1) Build web page structure by visually boxifying; (2) Determine repeated styles and semantic elements to create tags for; (3) Write your HTML; and (4) Apply styles: (a) size of boxes, (b) position of boxes; (c) details.
          <br>
          <br> Test: use Developer Tools to play around without having to change the underlying HTML
          <br>
          <br> Fix:
        </p>
        <p>
          These two websites are useful for checking whether your HTML and CSS, respectively, have the appropriate form:
          <br>
          <br>http://validator.w3.org/check
          <br>http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator
        </p>
        <p>
          An important idea to keep in mind while utilizing this methodology is the avoidance of repetition in your code. If your code is repetitive, you run the risk of incurring errors or creating inconsistencies. In terms of errors, repetitive code means that
          you must manually make any changes where repetitive code exists. Thus, if you forget to make the change throughout all of the relevant code, errors may occur. In terms of inconsistency, repetitive code also would require manual changes to assign
          style. Using the same <span class="code">div</span> with the same <span class="code">class</span> for consistent elements allows you to specify the style for that class in one CSS element rather than having to manually assign style
          for each applicable element.
